      <h2>Hi, thanks for stopping by.</h2>
      <p>My name is Marina Del Conte and I am Full Stack Software Developer who enjoys experimenting and creating fun, interactive designs through code. I am a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, and prior to enrolling in the Bootcamp, I was working in financial marketing as a Communications Coordinator. After much consideration, I decided to change career paths and pursue a career in software development. I am continuing to grow and expand upon my experience, and look forward to career opportunities to succeed as a Full Stack Software Developer. </p>
