        <h2>Hi, thanks for stopping by.</h2>
          <p>My name is Marina Del Conte and I am a Web Developer with a background in Marketing who enjoys creating clean, fun, and accessible content that can meet client goals and objectives. I have spent the last several years working in Marketing, which provided me with a good background of design, editing, and writing skills. In previous roles, I was often tasked with making website updates, which I greatly enjoyed and found that I was quite good at. Because of that, I decided to expand upon my skillset and enroll in a coding bootcamp. I have now graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp (click <a href="https://certificates-pod.sas.upenn.edu/7de50419-d912-4bdf-9b02-707a58301635#gs.adxv68" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> to check out my certificate!) and feel confident about my new skills that will enable me to help clients with all aspects of their marketing campaigns. I found that one of the most important parts of marketing a company is having a high quality website, especially considering that is probably the first thing people see when considering a business. Whether it is creating new website content, writing marketing materials, designing marketing content, creating new web pages or updating existing sites, I feel confident that I can be an asset that helps teams achieve their goals.</p>
