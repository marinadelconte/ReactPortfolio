      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p>My name is Marina and I am a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Prior to enrolling in the Bootcamp, I was working in financial marketing as a Communications Coordinator. After much consideration, I decided to change career paths and pursue a career in software development. I am continuing to grow and expand upon my experience, and look forward to career opportunities to succeed as a Full Stack Software Developer. </p>
