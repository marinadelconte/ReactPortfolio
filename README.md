# React Portfolio

## Description
The React Portfolio is a digital portfolio of my work so far as a software developer. When you visit the homepage, you will see options to view the following tabs: About, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact. Upon clicking on each tab, you will be taking to that corresponding page. This application was created using React and Bootstrap.
